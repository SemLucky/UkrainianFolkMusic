        		<b><p class="trueIntro">This is a website where I share every traditional Ukrainian music that I could find in the internet. Ukraine has the largest number of traditional folk songs in the world which is no surprise at all, Ukrainian is a very melodic language and Ukrainians all love to sing! Ukraine also has very many traditional instruments such as the Bandura which is the most well known. Most of the Ukrainian folk songs authors are unknown, some songs were written back in the 15th and 16th century by Ukrainian Cossacks who were constantly at war defending their land, or were written by Cossacks wifes who were left alone with their children while her husband went to battle. Ukrainian folk songs have a rich history and deep meanings, they are very peotic, mixes both sadness and joy which make them sound beautifully nostalgic, and a large amount of Ukrainian folk songs uses minor key signatures.</p></b>

        			<b><h1 class="love-ukraine">My love for Ukrainian folk music</h1></b>
        			<b><p class="love-music">When I was a child, I never thought about music as much as I do today, back than I simply hear a song and either like it or not - most of these were famous American bands. I have listened to some Ukrainian music when my family turned it on, but once again never thought about the history or meaning of it. One random day I heard a Ukrainian folk song called <a id="Stoit" href="https://youtu.be/ThKf9AhSuHI" target="_blank">"Oy, Chiy tam kin' stoit"</a> which translates to "Oh, who's horse is standing there" and I fell in love, that day this song became my favorite. I started researching more about Ukrainian folk songs and I started listening, finding every song, soon I created my first playlist which is filled with this music. I had knowledge about almost every Ukrainian traditional song, I didn't know if there was better music. I'm glad that day happened when I found this song, now life is so much easier when I listen to music from my country - knowing they're fighting to keep Ukraine and it's culture alive.</p></b>

        			<b><h1 class="experience">What's in this website</h1></b>
        			<b><p class="beauty">Ukrainian folk music is very unique and different compared to Ukraine's neighboring countries music. Traditional songs from my country aren't only happy, sad, determination, war songs - our songs could have one very sad message which sings with sarcasm while singing/playing melodies that are happy and sad at the same time, this sounds very nostalgic when music is mixed like this, melodies and lyrics - not like most modern songs which are just happy, just sad. Most of our traditional music is in the minor key and uses complex melodies, they are very short but beautiful, others long and majestic. A lot of Ukraine's folk music were written in war by soldiers in the 15th, 16th century and are known as "Cossack Music" while we were fighting the lots of enemies we had back then. Our music was censored during the Soviet Union and many of it lost or stolen but we still managed to keep our music alive - now and traditionally we sit at the table for dinner and sing these songs, we would say things like "Oh, how about this one" "Remember this one?". Folk music is the important music which defines a country and it's culture, and so this is what you'll be seeing in this website.</p></b>
